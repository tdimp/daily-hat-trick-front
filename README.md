# Daily Hat Trick Front End (Back end repo [here]: (https://github.com/tdimp/phase5-backend))s

Daily Hat Trick is a full-stack hockey stats tracking app where users can create teams of NHL players and track basic and advanced statistics for each player. Users can browse all NHL players by last name, or view each NHL team's roster. Rosters and statistics are updated multiple times per day, so users can be assured that the statistics they are seeing are up-to-date. The app does not currently support live stats updates, so users will have to check the morning following NHL games to see those stats added to the players' totals.

Once the back end is up and running, a user can create an account and start creating teams! The UI is intuitive and simple to use. What are you waiting for? Start winning your fantasy hockey matchups today!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Downloads and installs the app's dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
